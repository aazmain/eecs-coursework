    <h1>Azmain's Portfolio</h1>
    <p>Welcome to my website! My name is Azmain Alamgir, and I'm currently a
      senior studying Chemical Engineering at Northwestern University in
      Evanston, IL. Fascinated by science from a young age, I've developed a
      growing interest in reserach, particularly within the fields of bio- and nano-
      technology. My goal is to obtain a Ph.D in chemical engineering and
      (hopefully) pursue a career in academia in the future. Feel free to check out my
      bio, read about my reserach activites, or browse my blog posts. Thanks for stopping by! </p>
