    <h1>Azmain's Portfolio</h1>
    <p>Welcome to my website! My name is Azmain Alamgir, and I'm currently a
      senior studying Chemical Engineering at Northwestern University in
      Evanston, IL. Fascinated by science from a young age, I've developed a
      growing interest in reserach particularly within the fields of bio- and nano-
      technology, and I intend to pursue a career in academia in the future.
      Feel free to read my bio, reserach activites, or my blog posts. Thanks for
      stopping by! </p>
